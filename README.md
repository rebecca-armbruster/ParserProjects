## User documentation for using the executable parser files

The executable parser files have been obtained from the scripts in this repository using pyinstaller on windows 10 anaconda environment and can be downloaded from here: https://ukfcloud.kgu.de/index.php/s/jf939rP7OwXq7JE

To run the executable files simply copy the .xml-file and the xmlparser_{project}.exe in an empty folder and execute. The scripts takes 1-2 minutes to load.
